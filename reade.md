This exercise aimed to improve my use of loops, arrays, and conditions, and to work on my logic.

Throughout the exercise, I learned some JavaScript DOM concepts, namely:

- Modifying the content of an HTML element and its style while in JavaScript
- Using an event ('click') while applying a behavior to follow
- Regarding CSS, I used the grid concept.

Even though I didn't fully understand this exercise, I grasped some concepts that will help me repeat it without asking for help from anyone. And that's how we become efficient, because repetition is the mother of science.
